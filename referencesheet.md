### Initialize a Sigma program

#### Initialization before defining graph:  

```lisp
(init &optional <operator-names> <multiagent> <center-discrete-numeric-on-integer>)
```  
- operator-names: List of operator names used in task or a type definition to use for operator  
multiagent: either the number of agents (integer) or a list of agent names  
{% raw %}
```lisp
(init-operator <type-of-operator-specification> <operator-specification> &optional
<detect-impasses>); If operators not specified in init, can be specified later via init-operators 
```
{% endraw %}
- type-of-operator-specification: ‘symbols , ‘type or ‘predicates  
- operator-specification: If type is ‘symbols then a list of operator names, if type is ‘type then
either a type definition or the name of an existing type, if type is *‘predicates* then a list of
existing predicate names (predicates must have only universal discrete variables and no
user provided variables of type operator ) to use in generating operator instances for
combinations of discrete values across variables (each with its own operator id)    

#### Specify the form of selection to use for operators in the selected predicate: 
```lisp
(operator-selection <best or match-prob or Boltzmann>) ; best is the default  
```
#### Define types:  
```lisp
(new-type type-name &optional :numeric T :discrete T  
:min min :max max
:constants constant-list)
```
#### Define predicates:
```lisp
(predicate predicate-name &optional :world <world>
:arguments <arguments> :persistent <persistent>
:unique <unique> :select <select>
:exponential <exponential> :no-normalize <no-normalize>
:perception <perception> :function <function>)
```  
- world: *open* or *closed* (defaults to *open*)  
- arguments: list of arguments  
- argument: (<argument-name> <type-name> &optional <unique-symbol>)  
- unique-symbol: ! (select best) or % (maintain distribution) or $ (select expected value) or ^  
(maintain exponential transform of distribution [\** Experimental \**]) or = (select by
probability matching)  
- persistent: T or nil (overrides defaults, which are T for closed world defaults and nil for
open world)  
- unique: name of argument that is non-multiple [set automatically if !, %, $ or = are used], or
list of argument names if they are jointly unique    
- select: (nil, best, prob-match, boltzmann or expected ): What kind of selection, if any
to do over the unique variable, if there is one [set automatically if !, $ or = are used]  
- exponential: T or nil (whether to exponentiate outgoing messages from WMVN [set
automatically if ^ is used])  
- no-normalize: T or nil (whether to normalize outgoing messages from WMVN; may be used
to override default of T, and for unique predicates leads to combining positive actions via
addition and negative actions via subtraction)
- perception: T or nil (whether predicate can receive perceptual information)
- function: Can be a number, a list of region functions, a list starting with row-major followed
by a list of numbers (requires that all of the arguments be discrete, and that enough numbers
are provided to exactly fill all of the regions in row-major order) or the name of another
predicate (in which case it shares the same function

#### Define conditionals:
```lisp
(conditional conditional-name
&optional :conditions ; Quoted list of predicate patterns
:condacts ; Quoted list of predicate patterns
:actions ; Quoted list of predicate patterns
:function-default ; Default value for unspecified regions of function
:function-variable-names ; Variables in function (in order)
:normal ; Which variable(s) to normalize over in gradient descent learning
:function ; Function defined over function-variable-names
)
```
- function can be a number, a list of region functions, a list starting with row-major
followed by a list of numbers (requires that all of the variables be discrete, and that
enough numbers are provided to exactly fill all of the regions in row-major order) or
the name of another conditional (in which case it shares the same function, which
must use the same variables in the same order, and the same :normal variable if
there is to be learning)  

#### Define evidence: 
Define evidence by adding it to individual working memories
```lisp
(evidence evidence-list &optional empty-wms)
(perceive evidence-list) ; More appropriate version for use in perception. It enables
triggering of episodic and diachronic learning
```
#### Define goal for a predicate:  
```lisp
(goal predicate-name evidence-list) ; First argument is name of original predicate,
but the evidence list should use the name of its goal predicate (i.e., the original predicate
name followed by *goal
```
#### Initialize learning:
```lisp
(learn &optional <quoted list of learning specifiers>)
```
- :gd or :gradient-descent sets learn-via-gradient-descent to T
- :e or :episodic sets episodic-learning to T
- :am or :action-model sets automatic-action-models and diachronic-
prediction to T
- :pm or :perception-model sets automatic-perception-models and
diachronic-prediction to T
- :rl or :reinforcement-learning sets automatic-reinforcement-learning
and diachronic-prediction to T

Any form not mentioned is turned off  

### Format for predicate patterns (conditions, condacts and actions)
```lisp
(<predicate-name> <optional negation-symbol> <elements>) ; element-list must have an element for each argument in predicate definition
```
- negation-symbol: -
- element: (<argument-name> <value>)
- argument-name: a constant
- value: a or constant-region: 
 > (1) a constant, yielding an interval of length 1 starting there,  
 > (2) a *, yielding the entire scope of the dimension, or  
 > (3) a list (<min> <max>), where min and max are numbers specifying the  
beginning and ending of interval
; interval is always closed at min and open at max
- constant: a symbol or a number
- filters: (:filter <filter> ...)
- filter: (<constant-region> <constant> <coefficient>) ; Defines a linear value function over the
constant region. The outer product of the filters for all of the pattern’s arguments becomes
the message filter, which is multiplied times incoming messages.
- variable: (<variable-name> optional offset or <affine transform> or <filters> or <not-equal test>
or :explicit )
- variable name: A symbol (not a number)
- offset: a number specifying how far to offset from variable value (converted to affine)
- affine transform: (optional :from <variable-name> :offset <number or
variable> :coefficient <nonnegative number> :pad <nonnegative number>) ; :from
defaults to the current variable, :offset to 0, :coefficient to 1 and :pad to 0 for
closed-world predicates and 1 for open-world predicates. At present it shouldn’t be
necessary to use :from in an action, just use the corresponding condition variable, and
things may not work right in some cases if you do. :from can be used in conditions to map
from another variable, but it should only be used for variables in the same pattern. The
offset can only be a variable in an action, and then the smallest maximal domain element for
that variable is used as the offset.
- not-equal test: (<> <variable-name>); if the variable is discrete, and the variable after <> is of the
same type and has either been bound in the same pattern – if this is a condition – or in an
earlier condition (if this is a condition, action or condact), then limit matches of variable to
elements that are zero in <> variable (using an inverse of a delta function).
- :explicit : In a sense does the inverse of a summarization. Should only be used with a
variable in an action that is bound nowhere else, and where functional values are in [0, 1]. It
takes the functional value it receives and puts a 1 in the position along the variable’s type
corresponding to the fraction of the type before the functional value. <*** Highly
experimental ***>

### Format for a function
‘(<region-value> ...) or number ; If no function is specified, defaults to 1. Processes region-values
left to right, so can provide a default value first, and then alter subregions of it later
  
- region-value: (< function> <constant-region> ...) ; One constant-region per variable in
function  
- function: either a single number (for a constant function) or a list of numbers for the constant
and the coefficients associated with the variables

### Format for an item of evidence in evidence-list
(<predicate-name> <optional negation-symbol or function> <items>) ; Negation not allowed in
perception

- item: (<attribute> <constant-region>)

### Run a Sigma program
Pass up to n (default max-messages) messages or until quiescence:
```lisp
(run &optional n do-pre-run)
[(r &optional n do-pre-run)]
```
Make up to n (default max-decisions) decisions (each with up to max-messages messages if specified):
```lisp
(decide &optional n max-messages)
[(d &optional n max-messages)]
```
If n =0, break before decision; and if n=’d, continue through decision after break

Run n (default 1) trials (each of which makes decisions until halted):
```lisp
(trials &optional n continue)
[(ts &optional n)] ; continue is nil
```
Process a specific message from the queue:
```lisp
(m message-number)
```
To interrupt a run:
Type any character

### Debug

```
Undo the tracing turned on by debug-message (for when left on by an error)
```lisp
(undo-debug-traces)
```

```lisp
(product-plms plm1 plm2)
```
Compare two arrays of messages from ends of decisions:
```lisp
(compare-gmas gma1 gma2)
```
Compare two lists of message arrays (from first to last decision):
```lisp
(compare-gma-lists gmal1 gmal2)
```
[set track-graph-messages to T to have such a list saved in global-graph-messages ]

Break before a decision where there is a positive message between any listed pair of node numbers
```lisp
break-on-positive-messages
```

[(s node-number &optional color)]
```
Scroll to and highlight a particular node in the interactive graphical representation
```lisp
(sh node-identifier &optional color)
```
node-identifier can be a node number or a predicate name, in which case it goes to the
predicate’s WMFN node, or a conditional name, in which case it goes to the conditional’s CF

### System Types

It is also safest to avoid predicates ending in: *goal or *progress if using architectural goal
specification; and *episodic , -learn, -select and –retrieve if using episodic learning.  
```lisp

### Saving Sessions & Graphs

save a graph to a file 
```lisp
(save-graph "mygraph")
```
load graph from file 
```lisp
(load-graph "mygraph")
```
save session (lispworks)
```lisp
(save-sigma-session "mysession")
```
save session (CLISP): automatically saves file as ```lispinit.mem```
```lisp
save-sigma-session ()
```
both ```save-session``` functions save the file as a binary so you execute that file to restore your previous session, lispworks may require you to enter your license & key on the commandline

###Learn a naïve Bayes classifier from a data set
Each instance in the data set is one line in a file, with values for its attributes separated by commas

Learn from training data set and test on test data set
```lisp
(gdl train test &optional unsupervised training-cycles)
```
unsupervised : t (expectation maximization) or nil (supervised).

Define a data set:
```lisp
(define-data-set ‘(attribute-domain-list ...) &optional unsupervised) 
```
Define attributes and their domains (and if learning should be unsupervised)
attribute-domain-list: (<optional *> attribute-name domain-list )
If the first element is * (i.e., the category-symbol ), the attribute is the category
If no category is specified, the last attribute mentioned is the category by default
domain-list: (symbolic ...symbols...) or (<discrete or continuous > min max)

Specify an instance to be loaded into WM (all of WM is emptied first):
```lisp
(instance inst-string &optional omit not-in-data)
```
- inst-string : A comma-delimited string of values for attributes (including category)
- omit: Attribute names in the list are not read in (this is used to omit the concept name when predicting it during a test).
- not-in-data: Attribute names in the list don’t exist in the data (this is used for the category in unsupervised learning).

Set up training and test data sets:
```lisp
(setup-gd filename &optional test omit not-in-data)
```
Set up file to process one instance per decision.  

- test: when T, learning is turned off (and it is turned on when it is nil).
- omit: Attribute names in the list are not read in (this is used to omit the concept name when predicting it during a test).
- not-in-data: Attribute names in the list don’t exist in the data (this is used for the category in unsupervised learning).

### Parallel Execution
```lisp
(run-parallel function parameter-list &optional filename)
```
execute one instance of function for each parameter in the list, function must take exactly one argument.   

- filename : string representing a lisp file containing a definition for the function to be run  
over the list of parameters (not needed if you are running a function that’s already in sigma)  
- function : defined in filename, takes a single argument  
- parameter-list: a list of input parameters to be given to function  
Example: 
```lisp
SIGMA> (run-parallel 'runmodel '(1 0 2.5 3) "~/sigma/model.lisp")
```
### Regression Testing
- run all tests in parallel listeners
```lisp
SIGMA> (regression-testing)
```
- run all tests serially in current window
```lisp
SIGMA> (run-all-regression-tests)
```
